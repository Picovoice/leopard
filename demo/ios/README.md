# Leopard iOS Demo

## AccessKey

Leopard requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Leopard SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret. 
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Running the Demo

Before building the demo app, run the following from [LeopardDemo](/demo/ios/LeopardDemo) directory to install the Leopard Cocoapod:

```console
pod install
```
Open [LeopardDemo.xcworkspace](/demo/ios/LeopardDemo/LeopardDemo.xcworkspace`) and run the demo.
