## AccessKey

Leopard requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Leopard SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

### Server

Start the server first by running the following command from the demo folder:
```console
go run server.go \
--access_key "${ACCESS_KEY}"
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console and `${AUDIO_PATH}` with a path to an audio file you
wish to transcribe.

### Client

While the server is up, make a transcription request:

```console
```console
go run client.go \
--audio_file "${AUDIO_PATH}"
``````
